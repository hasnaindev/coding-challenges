# TwoSum

Let's say you have an array of numbers, [2, 5, 9, 1, 3, 7, 2] and a target value of 4, there are at least two numbers that when you add up, the sum will be equal to 4 (The target). Create a function that will return the indices of those two numbers which add up to the target value. Same index cannot be returned.
